    "## Arrays in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are a very useful and *fast* way of storing and manipulating like-type data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Their rapid computation is due to their property of initializing once at the beginning of a scipt and then referenced from then on without needing to rewrite a new array to memory. Lists, on the other hand, are slower because when a list is referenced and altered, the ENTIRE list has to be processed and written to memory. This effect does not matter all that much when dealing with small amounts of data. But if you have 1,000s or 10,000s of data points or are setting elements many times, arrays will save you significant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are not a part of the standard Python distribution, their functionality must instead be imported from separate libraries like `scipy` or `numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These arrays also include vectorization, meaning we can perform mathematical operations on the array as a whole rather than on individual elements. We'll show an example of this in a bit.\n",
